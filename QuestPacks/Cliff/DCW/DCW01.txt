QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>There’s a new captain of the watch in %cn and we
<ce>know he’s one who hates our kind. I wouldn’t be surprised
<ce>if he ended up killed by the Dark Brotherhood. I don't
<ce>care, really. What I’d like you to do is to go investigate
<ce>the city walls and check up if you can’t find something
<ce>that may help us get rid of him without violence. Are you
<ce>up to it?
<--->
<ce>I’m sure you heard of _dummy_? Well that bastard
<ce>got promoted to captain of the watch since his
<ce>predecessor died. He made it public that he’ll be going
<ce>against us and we can’t let that happen. I want you to
<ce>go get inside the city walls and get something that’d
<ce>help us change his mind. Can I trust you with this?
<--->
<ce>Time’s short, %lev. I got something for ya if ye
<ce>got the time. It’s about infiltrating the city walls and
<ce>return with something that may help us get the watch off
<ce>our backs. Ye in?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>If ye don’t want to infiltrate a place crawling with
<ce>guards, I can’t blame ye. I guess I’ll send %mn2
<ce>to do the job.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>Right. For this job, you’ll be working with _thief_.
<ce>Your guildmate will keep watch while you investigate the walls.
<ce>_loc_ We know the captain hangs around the walls %di of here.
<ce>Make sure you record that direction in that journal you carry,
<ce>since the folks on the street won't be able to point you in the
<ce>right direction. Get back here once you find something good,
<ce>ye hear? We have to make it quick, so get this done by =timer_ days. 
<--->
<ce>Hah! _loc_ That captain of the watch will get what’s comin’ to him. I
<ce>know he works the walls %di of here for the next =timer_ days, so
<ce>try the doors there. Write that up in your journal as I don't expect
<ce>the commoners to be of help._thief_ will be your spotter and
<ce>warn you if any guard’s on the way. Get in, investigate quickly,
<ce>and get back with whatever you find. Good luck, %lev.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>            

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>Here’s your pay for a job well done, both of you.
<ce>
<ce>“See ya, %pcf.” says _thief_.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
_dummy_’s the new captain of the __loc_’s city watch.
<--->
__loc_ has a new watch captain. They say he wants to rid the city of its criminals. 

RumorsPostFailure:   [1006]
They say __loc_’s outlaws are either on the run or imprisoned. The new captain of the watch saw to it personally, I heard.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Seems like the new captain of the __loc_’s city guards is as tame as the previous one. Crime still runs rampant in that town. Some of the outlaws had a part to play I’m sure. My money’s on either the Thieves Guild or the Dark Brotherhood.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
The guards have been quiet in ___loc_ since you took care of the watch captain. Good work.                

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
The guards have been giving us a hard time, %pcf. Thanks to you. Make it quick.

There’s a new captain of the watch in ___questgiver_.
The Thieves Guild wants to ensure he does not meddle in our business.
I am to investigate the city walls with a fellow guildmate to find
something that may help us convince the captain. According to the
instructions I received,_loc_ the city walls I must investigate should
be %di of where I am standing. 

Message: 1020
<ce>“%oth, I was hoping to be the one who sneaks inside the place.
<ce>Let’s go.”
<ce>says _thief_.
<--->
<ce>“%lev %pcf, good to be working with ya. I’m right behind ye.”
<ce>says _thief_.

Message: 1030
<ce>“This place seems empty. I’ll stay outside and keep watch.
<ce>If I see a guard coming, I’ll knock twice and walk away.
<ce>Make it quick, %pcf.”
<--->
<ce>“No living soul around here it seems. I’ll head back outside and
<ce>look out for company. I’ll knock twice if I see a guard. Have fun.”

Message: 1031
<ce>Two knocks break the room’s silence.

Message: 1032
<ce>Two frantic knocks are heard.

Message: 1033
<ce>The door opens, letting a member of the city watch inside.
<ce>
<ce>“What the? Who are you?” says the guard, startled.
<ce>
<ce>
[Do you attempt to bluff your way out using Etiquette?]

Message: 1034
<ce>Right, we got word we’d get a recruit. The last one died
<ce>a few days ago. Anyway, get accustomed to the place.
<ce>I’ll see you around.

Message: 1035
[The guards sees through your bluff]
<ce>
<ce>
<ce>You’re in luck, thief. My colleagues are right behind me.
<ce>Let’s get that scum, boys!

Message: 1036
<ce>“You got a wanted list? Hey look, we’re famous. Even the boss’
<ce>on there. There are some names I don't recognize. Maybe people
<ce>from the Dark Brotherhood? That seems like a good find.”

Message: 1037
<ce>You see _thief_ walking quickly towards a nearby alley.

Message: 1040
<ce>This wanted list is interesting. In fact, I don’t see a single
<ce>Wharf Rat name there. Coincidence? I think not. We’ll have our
<ce>forger change the names a bit. Give us two or three hours to
<ce>get it done.

Message: 1041
<ce>There you are! _thief_ got back here and told us you
<ce>managed to talk your way out when a guard came. Is that right?
<ce>Nice job. This wanted list is interesting. In fact, I don’t see
<ce>a single Wharf Rat name there. Coincidence? I think not. We’ll
<ce>have our forger change the names a bit. Give us two or three
<ce>hours to get it done.

Message: 1042
<ce>There you are! _thief_ got back here and told us the
<ce>guards jumped you. I don’t care if you got something from there
<ce>or not. They’ll know we were there for business, so you botched
<ce>the job. You botched it because you didn’t listen to your
<ce>guildmate. We’ll need to lay low because of you. %oth.
<ce>See yourself out.

Message: 1045
<ce>“You think we have time for some ale at %nt
<ce>while we wait?”
<ce>says _thief_.
<--->
<ce>“Do ye have cards with ya? We could play a game or two.”
<ce>says _thief_.
<--->
<ce>“We may as well loiter here until it’s done.”
<ce>says _thief_.

Message: 1046
<ce>Here, take this forged list and put it back where you stole
<ce>the original. Our names got replaced with well-known Wharf
<ce>Rats operatives in the area. We kept the names we didn't
<ce>recognize. We care only about our own. Get back to me once
<ce>it’s done.

Message: 1050
<ce>"Same plan as before, %pcf. I knock if someone’s coming."

Message: 1051
<ce>"That wasn't too hard. Time for payday, %pcf."

Message: 1060
<ce>All’s done? Very good. That’ll get the captain off our backs
<ce>until he gets killed by the Brotherhood and we may hear about
<ce>some Wharf Rats being jailed. What’s not to like?

Message: 1061
<ce>There you are! _thief_ got back here and told us you
<ce>managed to talk your way out when a guard came. Is that right?
<ce>Nice job. That’ll get the captain off our backs until he gets
<ce>killed by the Brotherhood and we may hear about some Wharf Rats
<ce>being jailed. What’s not to like?

Message: 1062
<ce>There you are! _thief_ got back here and told us the
<ce>guards jumped you. I don’t care if you dropped the document
<ce>where it was. They’ll know we were there for business, so you
<ce>botched the job. You botched it because you didn’t listen to
<ce>your guildmate. We’ll need to lay low because of you. %oth.
<ce>See yourself out.

Message: 1070
<ce>“You got a letter? Oh, seems like our captain got’s an affair.
<ce>That seems like a good find.”

Message: 1080
<ce>Let me see that love letter. 
<ce>
<ce>That’s perfect for some blackmailing. Here, take this letter
<ce>and drop it where you found the other one. The captain needs to
<ce>know he can’t play funny with us.

Message: 1081
<ce>There you are! _thief_ got back here and told us you

Message: 1090
<ce>All’s done? Very good. If the captain has any ounce of
<ce>wisdom, he’ll stay calm and won’t bother us.

My Sweet Flower,
<ce>
   Run away with me, far from __loc_. Leave
your dreadful wife and her obsession with
wealth. You are worth more to me than any
trinket from some faraway land. The same
cannot be said of her.
<ce>
   The world was bleak before I peered into
your radiant eyes. The most magnificent
mountains of Skyrim and flowing streams of
the Imperial Province are nothing compared
to your smile.
<ce>
   Let us leave this place. I am and will
always be your buzzing bee of love.
